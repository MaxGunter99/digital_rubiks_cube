For the top corner tests,

rather than generating millions of permutations to test well need to create these tests

test each top corner: 
	3 tests per top corner piece in all possible 8 corners, why 3? the color needed could be on the top or each side, so rotate the piece to get all possible variations of each

	in degrees: 0, 120, 240
