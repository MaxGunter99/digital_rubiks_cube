Create tests for each top cross piece.

Rather than generating and testing millions of permutations, create a test for each top cross piece
the top cross piece needs to be set in every middle space across the cube. Be sure to include the piece in the same spot but reversed values.
Include all top cross pieces in specific places, not just 1, this will result in less tests
